# Handoff - College Marketplace App

### Handoff is an app I designed and developed from the ground up using firebase and swift. It allows students to buy and sell items with people in their school. The entire application was built programmatically, and below is a technical description of how I developed the application and what cool features I built

###### If you would like to see the live application, please send me an email [here](aedanjjoyce@gmail.com) for a TestFlight invite. The application is awaiting to be submitted to the app store. So for now, the app lives on TestFlight. 

**Data Structures, Fundamental Algorithms, and Design Techniques Used**

1. Tree Traversal and n-ary search trees
2. Mergesort and Binary Search
3. Database Queries based on search text (used to search for users and posts on the app)
4. MVC design pattern used across the entire application
5. Pagination to throttle database calls and limit the amount of data that is fetched from the backend
6. Data persistence using Core Data

**Languages and Tools Used**

1. Swift to develop the frontend and connect to firebase
2. Node.js to delegate push notifications and local notification scheduling
3. Sketch App in order to design the application and create a wireframe of the application



**Notable Features**


1. A feed that allows users to view all the items posted by people they follow. 
2. A discover page that allows users to view items that people in their school are selling
3. A notification page that shows the user what they are buying and selling, as well as who is interacting with their items. 
4. A a real time chat feature that allows users to direct message others users within their school
5. A purchase method that works through QR codes. Each item is assigned a unique QR code that must be scanned by the buyer of that item in order for the transaction to go through.
6. An item posting page that allows users to either take a picture of an item or select up to 5 items from their camera roll.
